# Tik Tak Toe Game
## A Tik Tak Toe game built with React

### What Is It?
This is a Tik Tak Toe game where Player 1 is 'X' and Player 2 is 'O'. The program prompts each player during their turn. The first person to three in a row wins. You know the deal.

### Why Did I Make This?
MITxPro tasked us with improving a Tik Tak Toe game that we coded together for a module. It was interesting learning about how the parent and child components passed information back and forth. 

### Features I'd Like To Implement
I would really like to have it show an alert when the player wins. And I would like it to keep track of games won somewhere on the page. For the alert, I would include that in the `winner.js` file. It would pop up when a player gets three in a row. To keep track of games won, I would make that it's own component. It would track the players and keep the information in a table.
